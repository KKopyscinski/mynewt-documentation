## Porting Project Blinky to additional boards

### Objective

The goal of this tutorial is to download a generic firmware skeleton ("bootstrap image") that applies to any hardware and then throw in additional applicable eggs to generate a build for a specific board. 

The following target hardware chips are covered:

* [STM32F303VC MCU](#anchor1) from STMicroelectronics
* [nRF52 Series](#anchor2) from Nordic Semiconductors 


### [STM32F303VC MCU](id:anchor1)

#### Hardware needed

* Discovery kit with STM32F303VC MCU
* Laptop running Mac OS


#### Step by Step Instructions to build image

* The first step is to download the generic skeleton of the project. The eggs installed are not hardware architecture specific.

        [user:~/foo]$ newt nest create test_project
        Downloading nest skeleton from https://www.github.com/mynewt/tadpole...   ok!
        Nest test_project successfully created in ~/foo/test_project
    
        [user:~/foo]$ cd test_project/

* Then, the clutch of eggs named larva is added from the nest (also named larva) on the github. This step simply downloads the clutch description file and does not actually install the eggs that constitute the clutch. The clutch description file (`clutch.yml`) will be used to check dependencies during the egg install to ensure completeness. It serves as a reference for all the eggs in the clutch that one can choose from and install.
 
        [user:~/foo/test_project]$ newt nest add-clutch larva https://github.com/mynewt/larva
        Downloading clutch.yml from https://github.com/mynewt/larva/master... ok!
        Verifying clutch.yml format... ok!
        Clutch larva successfully installed to Nest.

* The next step is to install relevant eggs from the larva nest on github. The instructions assume that you know what application or project you are interested in (the blinky application, in this case), what hardware you are using (STM32F3DISCOVERY board, in this case) and hence, what board support package you need. 

        [user:~/foo/test_projec]$ newt egg install project/blinky          
        Downloading larva from https://github.com/mynewt/larva//master... ok!
        Installing project/blinky
        Installation was a success!
    
        [user:~/foo/test_project]$ newt egg install hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
        Downloading larva from https://github.com/mynewt/larva//master... ok!
        Installing hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
        Installing hw/mcu/stm/stm32f3xx
        Installing libs/cmsis-core
        Installing compiler/arm-none-eabi-m4
        Installation was a success!


* It's time to create a target for the project and define the target attributes. 

        [user:~/foo/test_project]$ newt target create blink_f3disc
        Creating target blink_f3disc
        Target blink_f3disc successfully created!

        [user:~/foo/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc project=blinky
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set project to blinky

        [user:~/foo/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc bsp=hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery

        [marko@Markos-MacBook-Pro-2:~/foo/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc compiler_def=debug
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set compiler_def to debug

        [user:~/foo/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc compiler=arm-none-eabi-m4
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set compiler to arm-none-eabi-m4
        
        [user:~/foo/test_project]$ newt target set blink_f3disc arch=cortex_m4
        Target blink_f3disc successfully set arch to cortex_m4
        
        [user:~/foo/test_project]$ newt target show blink_f3disc
        blink_f3disc
	        arch: cortex_m4
	        project: blinky
	        bsp: hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
	        compiler_def: debug
	        compiler: arm-none-eabi-m4
	        name: blink_f3disc
        
* Finally, you get to build the target and generate an executable that can now be uploaded to the board via the JTAG port. You can go into the openocd directory and start an OCD session as you did in Project 1.

* In order to be able to communicate with the SEGGER J-Link debugger on the dev board, you have to download and install the J-Link GDB Server software on to your laptop. You may download the "Software and documentation pack for Mac OS X" from [https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html](https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html). The command line version of the server is used in the steps below. 

* Open a new terminal and start a J-Link session.

* You need a configuration file for the GDB session to be opened correctly and the image ("blinky.elf") you built for this target downloaded to flash. A sample config script is given below. Alternatively, you could choose to type each command at the gdb prompt.

         [user@~/dev/nordic_blinky/project/blinky/bin/blink_nordic]$ cat jlink-gdb.cfg 
         echo ***Setting up the environment for debugging gdb.***\n
         set complaints 1
         set prompt (gdb) 
         set endian little
         echo \n*** Set target charset ASCII\n
         set target-charset ASCII
         echo \n*** Connecting over port #2331 ***\n
         target remote localhost:2331
         echo \n*** Enable flash write and set device to nrf52 ***\n
         monitor flash download=1
         monitor flash device=nRF52
         echo \n*** loading blinky.elf ***\n
         load ~/dev/nordic_blinky/project/blinky/bin/blink_nordic/blinky.elf 
         symbol-file ~/dev/nordic_blinky/project/blinky/bin/blink_nordic/blinky.elf
         echo \n*** Resetting target ***\n
         monitor reset
         echo \n*** Halting target ***\n
         monitor halt

* Start the gdb session and monitor that it loads the image, resets the target, and halts for a command to continue.
