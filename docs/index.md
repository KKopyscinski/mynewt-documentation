## Objective of Mynewt 


Mynewt is an open source initiative to build a stack of modularized control, networking, and monitoring software for embedded devices. The modular implementation allows the user the flexibility to mix and match hardware components and customize the software stack depending on the feature and performance requirements of the particular application he or she has in mind.

The world of Mynewt, therefore, has three primary collaborative goals:

* Build a modularized real-time operating system for a rich set of hardware components
* Offer a suite of software for efficient and secure two-way communications with an embedded device
* Develop method and tools necessary to create an optimized execution environment for the selected software on the desired hardware

The chapter organization is outlined below. Each Chapter has one or more tutorials for hands-on experience with the material in each chapter. 

* [Chapter 1: Getting Started](chapter1/intro.md) introduces some key terms in this initiative and includes a tutorial for a quick project to show how to work with some of the products.

* [Chapter 2: Getting Acclimatized](chapter2/vocabulary.md) delves deeper into the concepts crucial to the software development effort. 

* [Chapter 3: Newt Tool Reference](chapter3/newt_ops.md) is a detailed listing of the available commands to help you with your project.
