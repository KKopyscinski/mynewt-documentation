## Vision

We want to make it very simple for an application developer to pick and choose the hardware components for an embedded device and run their application on it in an optimized way. We invite you to join us in our efforts to develop the ecosystem of firmware, software, and tools needed to offer the higher level of abstraction to the application developers to enable them to be more productive.  

## What are the basic components?

* NewtOS is an open-source RTOS (Real Time Operating System) that is not tied to any particular hardware. It has support for multitasking, synchronization of tasks, scheduling and buffering of operations, memory management,file systems, networking, security, power management, and more features.

* Newt Tool helps you build the specific packages (image binaries) for the combination of hardware and low-level embedded architecture features of your choice. It provides you the infrastructure to manage and build for different CPU architectures, memory units, board support packages etc., allowing you to formulate the contents according to the low-level features needed by your project. It uses Godep which is a more generic package building tool.
