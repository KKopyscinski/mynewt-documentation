## Getting Started with MyNewt

### Introduction

We want to make it very simple for an application developer to develop and release application programs on an embedded device of their choice. With that in mind, we offer a complete suite of open-source software ranging from an operating system to network protocol stacks. We offer the user of our wares the flexibility to choose hardware component(s) and easily build a software platform for it with desired features and performance. 

We invite you to join us in our efforts to develop the ecosystem of firmware, software, and tools needed to offer the higher level of abstraction to various developers to enable them to be more productive and to decrease the time to market their applications on the embedded devices of their choosing.


### Next Steps to get started
